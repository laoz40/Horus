# Test proposals

## Proposals

### Stream the training graph before client authentication finishes

- Behavior: A signed-in user sees the current year's graph while the browser's session request is delayed. Hydration does not repeat the initial graph requests, and the year picker still fetches the selected year. Signed-out visitors see an empty graph without private data.
- Regression: Moving the graph behind client authentication again, mismatched hydration query keys, or rendering another user's cached graph.
- Risk: 7/10. A regression can expose private workout counts or restore a multi-second dashboard delay.
- Gap: `tests/auth.spec.ts` checks greetings and sign-in prompts, but does not assert graph contents, request sequencing, or year selection.
- Level: E2E, using the existing authenticated and signed-out browser flows with delayed client session responses.

### Refresh training counts after workout mutations

- Behavior: Visit the dashboard, create or edit a workout, then return within the query freshness window. The graph reflects the saved completed sets. Deleting a workout or all workouts also updates the counts and available years.
- Regression: The hydrated query cache or a cached server navigation restores counts from before the mutation.
- Risk: 6/10. Users see incorrect training totals after successfully saving or deleting workouts.
- Gap: `tests/create-workout.spec.ts` and `tests/workout-history.spec.ts` cover persistence and history, but do not revisit and assert the dashboard graph.
- Level: E2E, extending the existing create, edit, and delete journeys.
